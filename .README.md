# moove-terraform-modules

Repo holding all the moove-terraform-modules

Documentation for each module is auto generated by [terraform-docs](/terraform-docs/)

# Contributing

Modules in this repo should be made as generic as possible.

Applications that require unique permissions or resources should be created as an individual module.
* [atlantis](/atlantis/)
* [bigquery-watcher](/bigquery-watcher/)
* [terraform-docs](/terraform-docs/)

Applications that do something generic like create a k8s build should be reused:
* [k8s-bucket-trigger](/k8s-bucket-trigger/)
* [deployment/k8s](/deployments/k8s/)


## Doc Generation

This is mostly auotmatic, but we will need to include a header in `main.tf` of each module.
/**
 * # module_name
 *
 * Some words 
 * About this module
 * You think are important
 *
 * Written by (your name could be here!) for moove.ai
 */

The rest of the documentation is generated based on the input (`variables.tf`) and output (`output.tf`) files as well as the `proiveders.tf` file, if present.




# .README.md

This file is saved as .README.md because terraform-docs will generate a README.md in all directories, including the root one.

The build automation removes the extra README.md files and copies this file to README.md so it can be viewed in github
